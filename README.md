***Essentials*** is curated list of things I wish I knew about Objective-C, Xcode, and Cocoa Touch when I started programming iOS apps. The first few months of my iOS developer career were marked by spending entire days debugging annoying crashes or odd behavior that almost always turned out to be *one-liners* to fix. I became quite good at scouring the web for the solution to my problem, and do my best to [contribute back to the Stack Overflow community](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3132984/mike) when I can.

My goal for this project is to accumulate all of the interesting shortcuts, tips, solutions to problems easy or hard, and anything else I feel is worth sharing and archiving, for both myself and the iOS developer community at large to have as a reference. It will likely be a forever *work in progress*.
